The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an innovative resume scoring system leveraging the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. This system aims to automate the resume screening process, enabling efficient, accurate, and unbiased evaluation of resumes against job descriptions.

The goal is to transform traditional recruitment processes by reducing the time and resources spent on manual screening and minimizing human biases in candidate selection. 

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the potential of NLP to revolutionize recruitment processes, making them more efficient, accurate, and equitable.
